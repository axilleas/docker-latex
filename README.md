# docker-latex

This container came about because I was using [tianon/latex][] to build some
LaTeX documents, but GitLab took a long time to pull the container, so I decided
to attempt making a smaller version that will significantly improve CI build
times. In addition, I also wanted to be able to use a Makefile for building.
